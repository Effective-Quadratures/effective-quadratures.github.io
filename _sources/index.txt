   :description: equadratures is an open-source python code for uncertainty quantification, surrogate-based optimisation, numerical integration and data-driven dimension reduction. It is built on orthogonal polynomial approximations.
   :keywords: polynomials, polynomial chaos, optimisation, orthogonal polynomials, dimension reduction

:code:`equadratures` is an open-source python code tailored for **uncertainty quantification**, **surrogate-based optimisation**, **numerical integration**, and **data-driven dimension reduction**.

It does this by constructing orthogonal polynomials. It is particularly useful for problems where output quantities of interest are smooth and continuous and to this extent it has found widespread applications in computational engineering models.

To download and install the code please use the python package index command:

.. code::

	pip3 install equadratures
